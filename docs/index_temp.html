<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Gentrification and Displacement in Buffalo, NY</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle"><em>Using Census and Open Data to Map Neighborhood Change</em></h3>

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In September of 2017, the city of Buffalo announced the reassessment of over 95,000 properties, which will be the first reassessment done since 2010. Officials say, “The purpose of a property reassessment is to establish uniform, fair, and equitable assessments on all real property types” (Slawson, 2017). The total assessment value of each residential tax parcel determines how much a homeowner pays in property taxes each year, thus contributes to the development of city infrastructure. In recent years, some residential tax parcels have sold for much more than the assessed value, and are located in neighborhoods where revitalization efforts have taken place. The problem is that in some neighborhoods “property values have shot up so drastically that some homeowners are facing 30% tax increases, or more, compared to when they purchased their affordable homes a decade ago” (Buffalo Rising, 2018).</p>
<p>In recent years, some neighborhoods in Buffalo, NY have experienced a substantial increase in the prosperity of the population, others, however, experienced increasing levels of concentrated disadvantage. Here, I use the definition of gentrification given by The Encyclopedia of Housing as “the process by which central urban neighborhoods that have undergone disinvestments and economic decline experience a reversal, reinvestment, and the in-migration of a relatively well-off, middle- and upper middle class population” (Freeman, 2080). Gentrification can displace marginalized populations and most literature document that residential displacement results from increasing rent prices and or home values, no longer affordable for the residing population prior to neighborhood revitalization (LeGates &amp; Hartman 32).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gentrification is the process by which central urban neighborhoods that have undergone disinvestments and economic decline experience a reversal, reinvestment, and the in-migration of a relatively well-off, middle- and upper middle class population. ~ The Encyclopedia of Housing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the growing demand for up-to-date data that could provide insight into mitigation strategies for the negative consequences of gentrification, only a few studies “attempt to measure gentrification systematically or document the extent and the form of displacement due to gentrification” (Holm &amp; Schulz, 251). Traditional methods of measuring gentrification rely heavily on census data and analyzing key indicators of neighborhood change, such as increasing percentage of white population, higher incomes, and rising rents (Heidkamp &amp; Lucas, 104). This methodology is not able to analyze changing neighborhood dynamics in close-to-real time due to the infrequency of community surveys and the year lag time in results. In addition, as the geographic unit gets smaller, accuracy of the data also diminishes due to higher margins of error, thus blurring both perceived and established neighborhood boundaries in the dynamics of the change. New methods of quantifying changing cities are arising with the “emerging cloud of Big Data” that prove useful to supplement traditional methods to measure gentrification and displacement (Zook et al.) Open data portals provided by local government agencies are also incredibly valuable. These publically available datasets can provide useful information on neighborhood change at the household level.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to use the city of Buffalo’s Open Data Portal to analyze, visualize, and quantify gentrification based on the sold price of residential tax parcels above the total assessment value, and understand which changing socioeconomic variables play a role in the sale price of residential parcels over its assessed value. Very little academic literature discusses and analyses gentrification in Rust-Belt cities, but what exists says; “In Rust Belt cities like Buffalo, the [displacement] trend plays out differently than in booming coastal cities like San Francisco and New York. But for all these urban centers, increased public and private investment in downtown neighborhoods combined with changing cultural preferences toward urban lifestyles are changing the fabric of these cities in ways scarcely imagined a decade or two ago” (Sherman, 3). Quantifying displacement is problematic due to “lacking the ability to track ‘displacees’” (Atkinson, 149), which happens when data is not available at the individual level to understand migration patterns. Therefore, this project does not empirically analyze displacement, rather, it combines available tax parcel assessment and census data to analyze gentrification, then maps populations that are at the greatest risk of displacement based on potentially rising property taxes due to the city of Buffalo’s reassessment project.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<div id="measuring-concentrated-disadvantage" class="section level2">
<h2>Measuring Concentrated Disadvantage</h2>
<p>In order to properly quantify gentrification, it is necessary to measure urban decline and concentrated disadvantage within the city historically. “By definition, gentrification is reinvestment in and rebuilding of the physical structures that have undergone a period of disinvestment” (Heidkamp &amp; Lucas, 107). Neighborhoods that experience a period of disinvesment are often concentrated in disadvantage. Circumstances that make success (most often economically) unusually difficult make places disadvantaged, and “the presence of disadvantage weakens a place’s ability to achieve this goal [economic success]” (Weaver et al, 35). When multiple layers of disadvantage occur in a single location, concentrated disadvantage exists (36). By using the geometric mean of five disadvantage variables provided by the NCDB, I calculate concentrate disadvantage (CD) for the years 1970-2000. I use the same variables used by Weaver et al, 2017 in my calculations because all variables are represented as percentages, thus making comparisons across time consistent as they range from a value of 0-100. The equation is represented as:</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline"><em>G</em><em>i</em> = [(<em>P</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>N</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>w</em><em>h</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>i</em>)*(<em>P</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>F</em><em>e</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>H</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>H</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>l</em><em>d</em><em>s</em><em>i</em>)*(<em>P</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>U</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>m</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>y</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>i</em>)*(<em>P</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>P</em><em>o</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>t</em><em>y</em><em>i</em>)*(<em>P</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>L</em><em>o</em><em>w</em><em>E</em><em>d</em><em>u</em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>i</em>)]<sup>1</sup>/5, <em>i</em> : 1, 2, …, <em>n</em></span></strong></p>

<h3>Preliminary Analysis</h3>
<p>From 1970 to 2000, both the average and median geometric index of concentrated disadvantage (CD) nearly doubled, with the most dramatic increase being between the 1970 and 1980. While this shows that disadvantage increased in the city as a whole, it is necessary to analyse the spatial distribution of CD over time within the city as a precursour to the analysis of gentrification. Using the ‘tmap’ package and the function tmap_arrange, we can evaluate the extent of dispersion in CD.</p>

<p>CD from 1970 to 2000 spread in an intriguing way, with persistent high indices of disadvantage in the central business district (CBD) and expaning out to the city border on the east and west parts of Buffalo, with compariably low indices in census tracts directly North of the CBD. With the historical context in mind, I evaluate disinvested tracts as any tracts whose geometric index of CD is equal to or greater than the median (CD) of all tracts in the year 2000.</p>

<h2>Measuring Gentrification: Traditional Methodology</h2>
<p>In order to measure gentrification, I analyse changes in key variables provided by the U.S. Census Bureau that are used consistently in academic literature (Atkinson 2000, Heidcamp &amp; Lucas 2006, Freeman &amp; Braconi 2004, Holm &amp; Schulz 2017). These variables come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-year estimates. I examine change from the 2010 (2006-2010 estimates) and 2016 (2012-2016 estimates). This process involves a lot of data transformation in RStudio, I chose not to use the R package “tidyverse” due to the specific variables needed for analysis and the lack of variable full descriptions within the package. I instead download the required datasets from the US Census Bureau <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">factfinder</a>, and use the meta data to then filter the data by columns for variable selection. Due to the time involved in filtering the data by the metadata, I select variables of interest for future research in addition to the variables for this project alone.</p>

<p>The key variables that I considered to measure gentrification are based on the historical context of Buffalo after rapid deindustrialization and suburbanization that left the inner-city impoverished and segregated.</p>
<p>In the first step of the analysis I modeled the changes in key socioeconomic variables indicating gentrification and their influence on change in median home value using only census data. The gentrification variables considered for the regression analysis are :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Change in the household median income (increase)</li>
<li>Change in the percentage of white population (increase)</li>
<li>Change in the percentage of the population living in owner occupied housing (increase)</li>
<li>Change in the percentage of the population employed in managerial, technical, and professional occupations (increase)</li>
<li>Change in median rent (increase)</li>
<li>Change in the percentage of the population 25 years of age or older with at least a bachelors degree (increase)</li>
<li>Change in percentage of population ages 25-44 years of age (increase)</li>
<li>Change in the percentage of the population living below the poverty line (decrease)</li>
<li>Change in total population (increase)</li>
</ol>
<p>The change in all of these variables in each census tract must be considered in comparision to the average change of the City of Buffalo as a whole.</p>

<p>Changes in the key variables within neighborhoods that experienced a period of disinvestment, represented by concentrated disadvantage in 2000, between 2010 and 2016 establish the gentrification frontier. The gentrification frontier will be categotized as such:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Not gentrified - poor</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Census tracts that remained consistent or have seen decreases in affluent populations</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Not gentrified - high status</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Census tracts that may have seen increases in affluent populations but have historically low concentrated disadvantage (less than the median).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Potentially gentrifying</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Disinvested census tracts with some increase in affluent populations</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gentrifying</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Disinvested census tracts with inreases in at least half of the variables that represented gentrfication</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gentrified</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Census tracts that have seen increases in all of the gentrification variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>From 2010 to 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data, the city of Buffalo as a whole has seen an average increase in six out of the nine variables included in the gentrification assessment, only seeing a decrease in the percentage of white population, percentage of the population living in owner occupied housing, and change in total population. While it is apparent that, according to census data and traditional methods of measuring gentrification, the City of Buffalo is gentrifying as whole. It is imperative to analyze the spatial mismatch of disadvantage and affluence within city neighborhoods before making conclusions about the state of the city.</p>

<h2>Measuring Gentrification: Traditional Methodology with Open Data Assessment</h2>
<p><br>In recent years, some residential tax parcels have sold for much more than the assessed value and are located in neighborhoods where revitalization efforts have taken place. The total assessment value of each residential tax parcel determines how much a homeowner pays in property taxes each year, thus contributes to the development of city infrastructure. The purpose of this project is to use the city of Buffalo’s Open Data Portal to analyze and visualize gentrification based on the sold price of residential tax parcels above the total assessment value and understand which changing socioeconomic variables play the largest role the amount sold price was over the assessment value. By using R Studio, I will filter the data set to only include residential tax parcels that were sold between 2010 and 2016 for higher than the assessed value, which I will then group by census tract to portray descriptive statistics for each neighborhood. By using census data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2010 and 2016, I will analyze the socioeconomic change of key indicators of gentrification documented in the literature, also at the census tract level. In order to model this relationship, I will use a multivariate regression model to test the strength of the relationships.</br></p>

<p>This particular project only focuses on the residential tax parcels that have sold for more than their assessed value from 2010-present. The assessed value of parcels is based on The Assessment Standard Real Property Tax Law RPTL 305. This law states “All Real Property in each Assessing Unit shall be assessed at a UNIFORM PERCENT of value” and “value is defined as market value, or, the most probable sale price in a competitive and open market”(Erie County Real Property Tax Services). Neighborhoods that have properties that sold over the assessment value since the last city-wide reassessment will likely see an increase in their property taxes, even if their house was never on the market.</p>

<p>Modeling using the average sold price of homes (n = 65) for each census tract gives little insight into which socioeconomic variables contribute to how much a parcel sold for over its assessed value in Buffalo, NY from 2015-2018. The coefficient of determination (Adjusted R-squared) is 0.7192, meaning that the model explains about 72 percent of variability in sale price over the assessed parcels value, only three of the explanatory variables are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Modeling using the individual parcels for all residential parcels (n = 6,295) provides some insight into the socioeconomic explanatory variables that contribute to the variablity in the amount individual residential parcels sold for above the assessed value. The explanatory power of this model however, is very small (Adjusted R-squared), only explaining approximately 4.1 percent of the variability. One more gentrification variable proves statistically significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Percent change of owner occupied housing (2010-2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>Holding all else equal according to this model dictates that for each percentage increase in onwer occupied housing, the sold price of the home decreases by about 1,622 dollars. Comparing the first two models in terms of change in median income dictates:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Holding all else equal, for each dollar increase in a census tract’s median income, the average sold price of parcels sold above the assessed value increases by $1.79.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding all else equal, for each dollar increase in a census tract’s median income, the sold price of a parcel sold above the assessed value increases by $1.40.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Comparing the statistically significant explantory variables in each model can potentially allow one to make inferences on the strength of the gentrification variables in model 2, despite its low coefficient of determination. In an attempt to add explanatory power to the model, I evaluated the variability in property class type.</p>

<p>This showed that there is substantial variability in the amount that apartments, residential vacant land (with and without small improvements), and downtown row type housing sold for above its assessed value. I used the same explanatory variables to model gentrification’s impact on the sold price of residential parcels by property type and analyzed the similarities and differences between models.</p>

<p>I found that out of all the models that use individual tax parcels sold above the assessed value between 2015 and 2018, using the sold price of one, two, and three family dwellings as the independent variable (n = 5,582) had the most explanatory power with an adjusted R-squared of 0.3286. This model also has the most statistically significant genrification variables, with six out of nine variables at a 90% confidence interval.</p>
